history of the department the min h kao department of electrical engineering and computer science was formed in 2007 out of a merger between the computer science and electrical and computer engineering departments though eecs is relatively new the long established departments from which it was created have given it a rich heritage that can be traced back more than 120 years electrical engineering was first added to the university’s curriculum in the late 19th century around the same time incandescent lighting started illuminating campus charles perkins an associate professor of physics and electrical engineering was the only faculty member teaching electrical engineering courses to a handful of students in 1892 the university graduated its first student sidney albert beyland who received a bachelor’s in electrical engineering by 1896 the program was gaining steam with 85 students pursuing electrical engineering degrees the influx of students and the addition of new equipment expanded the university’s electrical laboratory to its limits in science hall the addition of estabrook hall to campus in 1899 made room for a new power plant in addition to experimental labs in 1907 electrical engineering became its own department perkins who still served as electrical engineering’s only faculty member assumed the position of department head he would also teach the department’s first graduate course offerings in 1913 in 1942 the united states’ entrance into world war ii caused a significant drop in the number of students studying electrical engineering at ut during the early years of the war the department was instrumental in training members of the us army air corps following the war enrollment skyrocketed with veterans returning to earn degrees under the gi bill more than 300 undergraduates were enrolled in electrical engineering courses by 1947 in the 1950s computers began appearing on college and university campuses across the country computers became a vital tool in research speeding up the process of calculating complex equations and streamlining the storage of vast amounts of data electrical engineering faculty members were at the forefront of the university’s new interest in computing science in 1958 department head paul cromwell found a way to bring the first digital computer to campus—a librascope general purpose 30 bit as computers became more prevalent demand for computer science courses increased at the time however computer science was still considered a field under electrical engineering and mathematics courses in programming and numerical methods were offered by the department of mathematics while courses on computers continued to be taught through electrical engineering in 1972 the department of computer science was created to offer a master’s degree within the college of liberal arts approximately 150 students enrolled in the program that fall in 1974 the tennessee higher educational commission approved a proposal for an undergraduate degree program to be added to the department a bachelor of arts in computer science the same year robert gregory became the first department head for computer

funding per full time equivalent faculty earning two multi year nsf infrastructure grants to support its work in parallel computation on multiple processors and grids of shared resources on july 1 2007 computer science officially merged with electrical and computer engineering to form the department of electrical engineering and computer science in may 2007 construction began on a six floor 150 000 square foot building to house the newly merged department this building was made possible through a generous gift from distinguished alumnus min h kao ceo and chairman of garmin international the department moved in during the fall of 2011 and on march 13 2012 min kao and his family helped mark the building’s grand opening in 2018 the department officially adopted min h kao’s name—the first department at ut to be so honored the min h kao department of electrical engineering and computer science was formed in 2007 out of a merger between the computer science and electrical and computer engineering departments though eecs is relatively new the long established departments from which it was created have given it a rich heritage that can be traced back more than 120 years electrical engineering was first added to the university’s curriculum in the late 19th century around the same time incandescent lighting started illuminating campus charles perkins an associate professor of physics and electrical engineering was the only faculty member teaching electrical engineering courses to a handful of students in 1892 the university graduated its first student sidney albert beyland who received a bachelor’s in electrical engineering by 1896 the program was gaining steam with 85 students pursuing electrical engineering degrees the influx of students and the addition of new equipment expanded the university’s electrical laboratory to its limits in science hall the addition of estabrook hall to campus in 1899 made room for a new power plant in addition to experimental labs in 1907 electrical engineering became its own department perkins who still served as electrical engineering’s only faculty member assumed the position of department head he would also teach the department’s first graduate course offerings in 1913 in 1942 the united states’ entrance into world war ii caused a significant drop in the number of students studying electrical engineering at ut during the early years of the war the department was instrumental in training members of the us army air corps following the war enrollment skyrocketed with veterans returning to earn degrees under the gi bill more than 300 undergraduates were enrolled in electrical engineering courses by 1947 in the 1950s computers began appearing on college and university campuses across the country computers became a vital tool in research speeding up the process of calculating complex equations and streamlining the storage of vast amounts of data electrical engineering faculty members were at the forefront of the university’s new interest in computing science in 1958 department head paul cromwell found a way to bring the first digital computer to campus—a librascope general purpose 30 bit as computers became more prevalent demand for computer science courses increased at the time however computer science was still considered a field under electrical engineering and mathematics courses in programming and numerical methods were offered by the department of mathematics while courses on computers continued to be taught through electrical engineering in 1972 the department of computer science was created to offer a master’s degree within the college of liberal arts approximately 150 students enrolled in the program that fall in 1974 the tennessee higher educational commission

the five year bs ms program is designed to allow qualifying students to take up to nine hours of approved graduate courses for their senior undergraduate electives and have them count toward both their bs and ms degrees thus reducing the amount of time it takes for a student to earn a master’s degree students must be in the process of completing or already have completed 96 hours of required undergraduate course work they must have an overall gpa of 3 4 or better when applying and continue to meet that minimum until graduation interested students should discuss their case with eecs master academic advisor mike taylor located in room mk401a and if qualified leave a correctly filled out admission course approval form with susan cormia located in mk401 all applications are reviewed and approved by professor jens gregor director of graduate studies the deadline for applying to the five year bs ms program is the first day of the semester in which a course will be taken the list of approved courses includes all lecture based 400 and 500 level ece and cosc courses listed in the graduate catalog note that 400 level courses will be approved only if the corresponding 500 level course is not offered in the same semester course approval may only be given for courses that have been scheduled students must submit an admission course approval form for each semester they take courses under the program approval will not be given retroactively students must obtain approval prior to taking a course approved courses will appear in dars under “masters program” once the bs degree has been conferred approved courses are automatically transferred to the ms degree by the graduate school during their senior year students may choose to instead request taking graduate credit that only count toward a graduate degree see graduate school instructions for senior requesting graduate credit the associated form is not needed for courses approved for the five year bs ms program students admitted to the five year bs ms program must follow the normal procedure for graduate admission including filing an application complete with references etc students are not required to apply for or accept admission to the eecs graduate program in order for the course credits to count toward the bs degree q why would i choose to do the five year bs ms program vs completing separate bs and ms degrees a two reasons with the five year bs ms program you get to double count up to 9 credit hours which means less course work for graduate school you’ll only need 21 hours instead of the regular 30 hours of coursework if admitted to the program you’ll become a preferred candidate for departmental scholarship and fellowships q why would i choose the five year bs ms program vs doing double bs degrees a if you are considering a double major you may want to consider this program with the same amount of work you will receive a bs degree and an ms degree instead of two bs degrees q would the five year bs ms program be appropriate if i were considering a phd someday a being in the five year bs ms program does not conflict with phd study at all if for any reason you decide to apply for the phd program instead of the five year bs ms program the graduate credits can still be counted toward your phd degree q do i need to take the graduate record examination gre when applying to graduate school a no the gre is not required for ms applicants q what thesis options are available to students in the five year bs ms program a students have the same three thesis options course only with 24

in the world of technology there have been very few things that have driven conversation more in the last few years than 5g technology and what it could mean for users now the university of tennessee

opportunities for innovation and collaboration that could change the lives of tennesseans ” one of the oft repeated concerns about 5g technology is the fear that it might increase the urban rural

the need for ever faster computing continues to grow helping those machines play an important role in simulation modelling and artificial intelligence in ways that touch almost all aspects of modern life keeping up with those demands has also required finding new more efficient ways of accessing memory and storing data assistant professor michael jantz of the min h kao department of electrical engineering and computer science understands those needs well we are going to have to develop new approaches for how we manage data in memory data movement and storage are still major bottlenecks for many computing applications and conventional memory technologies have already been scaled to their physical limits ” jantz has devised a concept that could further fuel computing performance by better managing how data and memory are used he explained that conventional memory storage requires constant voltage using the example of someone losing files or projects when the computer crashes or suddenly restarts such memory is called “volatile ” as it can be lost if power is interrupted but offers low response times and good overall performance on the other hand disk based storage is typically non volatile files and other application data can be stored permanently on hard drives but these technologies have the disadvantage of being much slower jantz’s solution proposes taking advantage of select parts of both by better understanding how applications and software interact with and use data in memory “new storage class memory systems allow you to have persistent data but can also be used like traditional memory ” jantz said “because they don’t draw as much power you can manufacture them with much larger capacities a modern volatile memory unit might hold up to 32 gigabytes of storage but the newer storage class memory units can store up to 512 gigabytes or more in the same physical area ” to get a better idea of what works best for individual applications the team is studying how performance is affected when applications use different types of memory storage “we first have to understand what portions of an application’s data should go where in terms of memory use before we can design a program to better control how memory is utilized ” he said “someone doing data analytics might only want a small amount of very fast memory whereas an application that uses large tables or creates a database might prefer a persistent storage medium with more capacity even if it’s not quite as fast ” he pointed out that the way that software interacts with memory and its underlying hardware technologies are largely unchanged since the 1970’s although obviously the demands placed on machines and the expectations of what they can do has increased greatly jantz will make the project’s results data and coding public both during the project itself and at least five years after it is set to conclude in 2025 the need for ever faster computing continues to

the garcia sisters enjoy a unique support system as first generation college students they have each other before eldest sister frances completed her master’s degree this past december the trio studied electrical engineering together at ut younger siblings diane and christine are still on campus embodying the spirit of “familia ” the supportive community approach promoted by the society of hispanic professional engineers shpe which all three have been involved with their close family connection enhanced their experience all the more “there were definitely advantages ” said christine “i knew how professors taught the classes because my sisters had taken the class before and they also had notes and tips they definitely helped me gear my study habits to be more successful ” “the main advantage i saw was having backup ” agreed frances “if i was stressed bored had something exciting to share or wanted a friend to go to the gym with i could just hang out with them ” “it helps that we’re all three in electrical engineering hispanic and female ” said diane “and we’re family so everything is relatable when i’m thinking something and laughing christine is probably thinking the same thing and laughing ” the sisters’ strong relationship helped them engage socially from playing intramural soccer together on campus to participating in groups like shpe systers women in eecs ieee and the campus entertainment board earlier they all enjoyed pre college summer programs at ut “i always knew i wanted to do engineering through programs like instep ” said diane the same summer that diane did instep i did the mites program that was our first experience with ut engineering frances got to go to the tennessee governor’s academy for math and science when she was a junior in high school ” these introductions inspired them all to pursue engineering at ut which has included a commute from their home in nearby lenoir city “it helped all of us because commuting is hard ” said diane “but since we were all in the same ballpark we all went home to the same home every night we would make sure we were all on track now we don’t carpool because our schedules are a lot more different ” frances blazed the trail as the first to graduate and now works as a microelectronics engineer at nswc crane with the navy and department of defense in indiana “to some degree i felt a sense of leadership and responsibility to guide my sisters into making advantageous academic choices ” she said “i would try to help out with homework questions they might have or studying for exams whenever i could ” “she definitely set the groundwork for us in understanding what’s expected to be successful ” said christine “it was hard transitioning from high school to college but she definitely helped that transition go smoother since she experienced it before we did ” diane and christine both work at einstein bros bagels offering them a good third space to commune over electrical engineering they use facetime to talk daily with far off frances both are already planning their summer “i’m going to do an internship this summer with us cellular ” said christine “i’ve done undergraduate research on power systems so this will expand the umbrella of what i’ve done because that’s more telecommunications ” “i’m looking for this coming year to get a co op ” said diane who is working through the office of engineering professional practice for that “i am interested in the automotive industry ” through studies soccer or careers the garcias’ family bond and volunteer spirit should continue to serve them along whatever paths they decide the garcia sisters enjoy a unique support system as first generation college students they have each other before eldest sister frances completed her

groups like shpe systers women in eecs ieee and the campus entertainment board earlier they all enjoyed pre college summer programs at ut “i always knew i wanted to do engineering through programs like instep ” said diane the same summer that diane did instep i did the mites program that was our first experience with ut engineering frances got to go to the tennessee governor’s academy for math and science when she was a junior in high school ” these introductions inspired them all to pursue engineering at ut which has included a commute from their home in nearby lenoir city “it helped all of us because commuting is hard ” said diane “but since we were all in the same ballpark we all went home to the same home every night we would make sure we were all on track now we don’t carpool because our schedules are a lot more different ” frances blazed the trail as the first to graduate and now works as a microelectronics engineer at nswc crane with the navy and department of defense in indiana “to some degree i felt a sense of leadership and responsibility to guide my sisters into making advantageous academic choices ” she said “i would try to help out with homework questions they might have or studying for exams whenever i could ” “she definitely set the groundwork for us in understanding what’s expected to be successful ” said christine “it was hard transitioning from high school to college but she definitely helped that transition go smoother since she experienced it before we did ” diane and christine both work at einstein bros bagels offering them a good third space to commune over electrical engineering they use facetime to talk daily with far off frances both are already planning their summer “i’m going to do an internship this summer with us cellular ” said christine “i’ve done undergraduate research on power systems so this will expand the umbrella of what i’ve done because that’s more telecommunications ” “i’m looking for this coming year to get a co op ” said diane who is working through the office of engineering professional practice for that “i am interested in the automotive industry ” through studies soccer or careers the garcias’ family bond and volunteer spirit should continue to serve them along whatever paths they decide the garcia sisters enjoy a unique support system as first generation college students they have each other before eldest sister frances completed her master’s degree this past december the trio studied electrical engineering together at ut younger siblings diane and christine are still on campus embodying the spirit of “familia ” the supportive community approach promoted by the society of hispanic professional engineers shpe which all three have been involved with their close family connection enhanced their experience all the more “there were definitely advantages ” said christine “i knew how professors taught the classes because my sisters had taken the class before and they also had notes and tips they definitely helped me gear my study habits to be more successful ” “the main advantage i saw was having backup ” agreed frances “if i was stressed bored had something exciting to share or wanted a friend to go to the gym with i could just hang out with them ” “it helps that we’re all three in electrical engineering hispanic and female ” said diane “and we’re family so everything is
